        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

### Advanced Usage with Custom Labels

```yaml
- name: Label Issue with LLM
  uses: your-username/llm-labeler@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
    openai-endpoint: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
    openai-model: "gpt-4o-mini"
    custom-labels: |

| Input             | Description                                   | Required | Default                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| `github-token`    | GitHub token for API access                   | Yes      | -                           |
| `openai-api-key`  | OpenAI API key                                | Yes      | -                           |
| `openai-endpoint` | OpenAI API endpoint                           | No       | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| `openai-model`    | OpenAI model to use                           | No       | `gpt-4o-mini`               |
| `custom-labels`   | JSON array of custom labels with descriptions | No       | `[]`                        |

## Outputs

| Output           | Description                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `labels-applied` | Comma-separated list of labels applied to the issue |
| `type-applied`   | Type classification applied to the issue            |

## Custom Labels Format

Custom labels should be provided as a JSON array with label and description fields:

```json
[
  {
    "label": "security",
    "description": "Security-related issues or vulnerabilities"
  },
  {
    "label": "performance",
    "description": "Performance optimization or issues"
  }
]
```

## Required Permissions

The GitHub token needs the following permissions:

- `issues: write` - To apply labels to issues
- `contents: read` - To read repository content

## Setup

1. **Add OpenAI API Key**: Add your OpenAI API key as a repository secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. **Create Workflow**: Add the workflow file to `.github/workflows/` in your repository
3. **Configure Permissions**: Ensure the workflow has the required permissions

## How It Works

1. **Trigger**: Action runs when issues are opened or edited
2. **Analysis**: Sends issue title and description to OpenAI for analysis
3. **Classification**: AI returns structured output with labels and type
4. **Validation**: Filters suggested labels to only include available ones
5. **Application**: Applies labels and type to the GitHub issue
6. **Label Creation**: Creates any missing labels in the repository

## Examples

### Example Issue Analysis

**Input Issue:**

- Title: "App crashes when clicking the login button"
- Description: "The mobile app crashes consistently when users try to log in..."

**AI Analysis Result:**

- Labels: `bug`, `help wanted`
- Type: `Bug`
- Reasoning: "This is clearly a bug report describing a crash issue that needs immediate attention"

### Example with Custom Labels

**Input Issue:**

- Title: "Add OAuth authentication support"
- Description: "We need to implement OAuth2 authentication for better security..."

**AI Analysis Result:**

- Labels: `enhancement`, `security`, `api`
- Type: `Feature`
- Reasoning: "This is a feature request for authentication enhancement with security implications"
